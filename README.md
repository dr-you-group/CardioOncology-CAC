# CardioOncology-CAC

**Objective**

Despite the prognostic value of coronary artery calcium (CAC) for future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), its application remains limited in cancer patients. 

To validate the clinical utility of artificial intelligence-based CAC scores, we assessed the association between automated CAC scoring from non-electrocardiogram-gated chest computed tomography (CT) and the risk of ASCVD in colorectal and gastric cancer patients.
